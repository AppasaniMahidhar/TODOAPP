# TODOAPP
This Java Swing To-Do app lets users manage tasks in a simple GUI. It provides an input field to add tasks, a list to display them, and buttons to mark tasks as complete or delete them. It uses `JFrame`, `JList`, `JTextField`, and `JButton` with `ActionListener` to handle actions, making task management interactive and user-friendly.
